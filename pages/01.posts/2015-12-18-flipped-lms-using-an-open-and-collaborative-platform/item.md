**What is a flipped LMS?**  
A flipped LMS approach is where an _open_ platform, in the _control_ of course participants, serves as an _alternative front-end_ to the institutional LMS

**Why flip the LMS?**  
<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> To support pedagogical goals unmet by current LMS/platform  
<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> To deliver a better student (and facilitator) experience  
<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> To increase capability of access, sharing and collaboration

**What to “Flip” Your LMS With?**  
Ideally an open and _collaborative_ platform, as shown below:

For example, the modern flat-file CMS [Grav](http://getgrav.org) along with [GitHub](http://github.com) and an automatic deployment service such as [Deploy](http://deployhq.com) can be used quite effectively by tech-savvy educators as an open and collaborative platform to support a flipped-LMS approach:

**When flipping your LMS what are some key experience design goals?**  
Student experience design goals:  
<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> Engaging  
<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> Organized  
<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> Relevant  
<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> Convenient  
<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> Enjoyable  
<br>
Facilitator experience design goals:  
<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> Controllable (i.e. manageable)  
<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> Pliable (i.e. flexible)  
<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> Efficient  
<i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> Enjoyable (hey, instructors are people too...)      <br><br>
Want to get started with flipping your own LMS? Since this article was written I've built an open source project using the Grav CMS to help other tech-savvy instructors - explore the [on-line demo](http://demo.hibbittsdesign.org/grav-course-hub/) and then head over to [Grav Course Hub Getting Started Guide](../2016-02-12-grav-course-hub-getting-started-guide) to get going.
