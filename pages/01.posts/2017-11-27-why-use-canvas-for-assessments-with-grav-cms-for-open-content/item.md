I am excited to be part of [SFU's DEMOfest](http://www.sfu.ca/tlc/programming/special/2017-demofest.html) this year, where I will be presenting and discussing with my fellow educators the advantages of using the Canvas LMS with Grav:

## Canvas Assessment Strengths
* Assignment submissions and rubrics
* Surveys, quizzes, and graded discussion forums
* Multi-course calendar and gradebook  
**_A safe place for student assignments and data, and where most of our students are!_**

## Grav Content Management System Strengths
* Free open source software (FOSS) project
* A modern flat-file (no database) CMS, which supports custom page types and modular content
* The platform-independent format Markdown is supported, and pages remain as individual files
* Fully extensible, with support for HTML, CSS, Twig, JavaScript, Google Fonts, YAML, etc.  
**_For tech-savvy educators a modern and flexible platform under their full control!_**

===

## Grav Open Course Hub Project
* Ready-to-run FOSS project, which includes the Grav CMS
* Provides a blog-like homepage, with areas for important reminders and class preparations
* Example schedule, resources and syllabus pages are included, and custom pages can be added
* Provides a ‘chromeless’ mode, perfect for embedding multi-device friendly pages into Canvas
* Ability to easily sync content to a Git (GitLab, GitHub, etc.) repository using the Git Sync Plugin
* Git repository enables student contributions, support for desktop mirroring/editing, and 5R’s of OER
* Edit content with the app of your choice, and easily upload your changes using GitHub Desktop  
**_A ready-to-run package designed to support a blended course, inside or outside of Canvas!_**
