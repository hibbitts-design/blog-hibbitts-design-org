_I recently [tweeted the key highlights of the new Grav Open Publishing Space](https://twitter.com/hibbittsdesign/status/900766902493904896), and I thought I would share them here:_

1. Leverages a modern flat-file (no database) CMS for the creation, presentation, and maintenance of open content
2. Supports collaboration and version control of open content (e.g. GitHub, GitLab, etc.), critical for sustainable #OER
3. Makes open content more future-ready through CMS-independent access (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)
4. Provides direct access to open content files for site visitors (i.e. Markdown, images, etc.)
5. Display collaborative Markdown-based open content within other systems (via 'Chromeless' mode that presents content-only pages)
6. Ability to quickly and easily update open content locally, using the text editing tools of your choice
7. Provides a mobile and multi-device friendly visual presentation of your open content
8. Optional Creative Commons license display, plus various additional features like custom menus and a Markdown-based sidebar widget
