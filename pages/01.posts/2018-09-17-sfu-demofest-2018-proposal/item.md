[SFU's](https://www.sfu.ca/) fourth annual DEMOfest is scheduled for Wed, November 21st and I hope to share with my fellow educators how the Grav CMS can be used to expand and enhance Canvas - here's my submitted proposal:  

**Expanding and Enhancing Canvas with the Open Source Grav CMS**  
Tech-savvy educators! Want to incorporate more open and collaborative materials within Canvas? How about improving the online experience? Faced with this challenge, Paul Hibbitts developed components for the file-based Grav CMS ([getgrav.org](https://getgrav.org/)) to effectively work inside of his CMPT-363 Canvas course ([https://canvas.sfu.ca/courses/38847](https://canvas.sfu.ca/courses/38847)). Grav uses the platform-independent Markdown format and enables collaborative editing by students and instructors with Git-based services such as GitHub and GitLab. These also naturally support the 5 Rs (Retain, Reuse, Revise, Remix and Redistribute) of Open Educational Resources. Integrating Grav pages within Canvas is seamless too - without any content restrictions.
