I've been feverishly working in the open on the Fall 2016 Course Hub (built with my Grav Course Hub and using a flipped-LMS approach, naturally!) for [SFU](http://www.sfu.ca/) [CMPT 363](https://www.sfu.ca/students/calendar/2016/spring/courses/cmpt/363.html) so that potential students can better self-assess course fit before online registration starts on July 4th.  

A significant change to the course this year is that students will research and design potential user experience improvements for an open source project of their choice. Also, the entire course outline is a structured as a series of questions, which will be examined, discussed and experienced as the course proceeds.

You can check out the under construction Course Hub at [paulhibbitts.net/cmpt-363-163/](http://paulhibbitts.net/cmpt-363-163/).
