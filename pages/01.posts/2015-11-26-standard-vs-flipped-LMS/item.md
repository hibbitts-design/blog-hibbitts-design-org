In a recent discussion the question of how a traditional LMS implementation compares to a [flipped LMS](../redefining-a-flipped-lms-approach) was asked. Here are my initial thoughts so far, based on my experiences with several institutional LMSs and using the flat-file CMS [Grav](http://www.getgrav.org) in a flipped-LMS approach:

===

|Traditional LMS Implementation &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | Flipped-LMS Approach |
|:------------- |:-------------
|Institutional Control |   Instructor & Student Control  |
| Closed |  Open |
| Fixed | Pliable |
| Solitary | Collaborative |
| Stationary | Portable |
