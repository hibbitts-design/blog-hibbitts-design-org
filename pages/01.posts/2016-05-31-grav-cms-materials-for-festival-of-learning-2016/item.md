The upcoming [Festival of Learning (June 6 â€“ 9, 2016)](https://festival.bccampus.ca/) is shaping up to be quite the event, with nearly 400 registrants at last count. I am really looking forward to attending, and will also be sharing lots of open source [Grav](https://getgrav.org/) goodness at both the Maker Faire and my Studio session 'Moving Beyond the LMS with Grav'.

===

Here are the materials I have prepared for the event so far:

**Maker Faire (Wednesday, June 8th at 9:00am until noon)**

**Moving Beyond the LMS with Grav Studio (Thursday, June 9th at 1:00pm to 4:00pm)**
