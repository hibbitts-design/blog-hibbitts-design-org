[SFU's](https://www.sfu.ca/) fifth annual DEMOfest is scheduled for Tuesday, November 19th and I hope to share with my fellow educators my first experience with student-generated assessment questions - here's my draft proposal:  

**Student-Generated Assessment Questions: The Journey so Far**  
Six years ago, I decided to stop using final exams in my [CMPT-363 User Interface Design](https://paulhibbitts.net/cmpt-363/193/home) course as I was dissatisfied with their correlation to student learning. However, this year I decided to use a final exam once again but with a critical difference - my students would be the ones (hopefully) creating it. I designed a process where students would write a potential final exam question every week, and Canvas would be leveraged to calibrate and assess the quality of questions. In this session, I will share what I've learned so far, and what lies ahead.
