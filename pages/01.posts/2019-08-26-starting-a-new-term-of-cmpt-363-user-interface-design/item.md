It's a cliche (for a good reason), but I it's hard to believe the summer is almost over and the fall teaching term is about to begin.

Over the summer I continued working on all of my Grav open education and publishing projects. A highlight was the brand new Grav skeleton package [Open Presentation Hub](https://demo.hibbittsdesign.org/grav-skeleton-open-matter-presentation-hub-site/) to help create, publish, and share Markdown-based slides with the [Presentation Plugin](https://github.com/OleVik/grav-plugin-presentation) by Ole Vik, which uses the Reveal.js Framework.

===

My largest project in the past several weeks though has been getting ready for my latest [SFU CMPT-363 User Interface Design course](https://paulhibbitts.net/cmpt-363/193/home), which naturally uses the Open Course Hub project. This term I've configured the site to be accessed both as a standalone site and within the [Canvas LMS](https://canvas.sfu.ca/courses/47119) for those students who also have other courses within Canvas - let's see how the students find it!

I've also recently released several small updates for the [Bootstrap4 Open Matter](https://github.com/hibbitts-design/grav-theme-bootstrap4-open-matter) theme (used by Open Course Hub and Open Presentation Hub) to improve handling MultiCourse setups, and as well some small updates to the [Quark Open Publishing](https://github.com/hibbitts-design/grav-theme-quark-open-publishing) theme.


Hope you enjoy the last week of summer!
