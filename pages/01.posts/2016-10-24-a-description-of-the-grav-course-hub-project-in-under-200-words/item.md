Grav Course Hub is an [open source project](https://github.com/hibbitts-design/grav-skeleton-course-hub) intended to help tech-savvy instructors enhance the learning experience for their students by providing multi-device delivery and a collaborative workflow not present in their current Learning Management System (LMS). As an open platform under the full control of the instructor, a broader choice of online course components can be integrated into the Course Hub to help reach unmet pedagogical goals.

Built with the modern flat-file CMS Grav ([https://getgrav.org/](https://getgrav.org)), the multi-device ready Grav Course Hub can partner with your existing LMS, where it serves as an alternative and customizable front-end to any required LMS elements for your students. With this approach, instructors have the freedom to move beyond the confines of the LMS while sensitive student data remains located within your institutional or organizationâ€™s LMS.

Content in Grav is stored and maintained as individual files rather than inside a database, so services such as [GitHub](https://github.com/) and [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/) (which can be hosted on your own server) can be easily partnered with your Course Hub for open collaboration and version control. Being file-based also means that instructors have their choice of tools for editing their Course Hub content, and site updates can be performed in as little as one button press.
