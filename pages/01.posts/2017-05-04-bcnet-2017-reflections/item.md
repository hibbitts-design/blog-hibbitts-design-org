It was a pleasure to be a part of the BCNET Higher Education IT Conference in Vancouver last week. In particular, various discussions with my fellow attendees helped me to further clarify the positioning of the [Grav CMS](http://getgrav.org) for use in the field of education.

===

If an instructor or student has moderate tech skills, a ready-to-run Grav skeleton (such as Open Course Hub or ePortfolio Blog) can be a pretty good match, but for someone to start from a theme alone things are more involved than something similar with a traditional CMS. However, for someone who is quite tech-savvy, it is much easier and faster to customize content structure and presentation in Grav.

For example, I could never have developed my [set of open education projects](http://learn.hibbittsdesign.org/) for Grav using a traditional CMS like WordPress (most due to Grav's use of the [Twig templating language](https://twig.sensiolabs.org/) and elegant layered architecture). Given the above, the pre-packaged approach that Grav offers is really one of its standout aspects, certainly in the field of education. And let's not forget that the native file format syncing of content using the Git Sync by [Trilby Media](https://trilby.media/) is still the bomb.üëç
