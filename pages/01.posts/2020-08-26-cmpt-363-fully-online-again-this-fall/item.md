Wow, it's been a while since I last posted something here... I've been full-steam ahead learning from my students in the first fully online CMPT-363 this summer at [SFU](https://www.sfu.ca/).

While not originally planned, I am very excited to teach CMPT 363 User Interface Design once again this fall. I've already been working on some structural course changes based on feedback from this summer's students, and more still to do.

For students not in other Canvas LMS courses a [multi-device site with Canvas links](https://paulhibbitts.net/cmpt-363/203/home) is available, and for students in other Canvas courses content is [seamlessly embedded into Canvas](https://canvas.sfu.ca/courses/56304).

I can't wait to connect with my new students in September, but in the meantime I will try to sneak in the last bit of summerðŸ™‚
